# Biopython-Project
This project involved the functional characterization of an unknown biological sequence using a single continuous bioinformatics pipeline.  Sequence in FASTA format was first analyzed quality using BioPython to ensure reliability. After validation the sequence was subjected to BLAST based homology analysis similar sequences in public databases
